## ⭐ The STAR Method: Our Project Journey

- **Situation:**  
  Many learners struggle to grasp the concepts behind sorting algorithms due to abstract theory and static examples.

- **Task:**  
  Create an interactive, visual tool that demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work, step by step, in a clear and engaging manner.

- **Action:**  
  - Designed a responsive web interface for a visually appealing experience.  
  - Developed dynamic animations with JavaScript to bring each algorithm to life.  
  - Incorporated core DSA principles to accurately model the behavior of each algorithm.

- **Result:**  
  Users can now **visually understand** the mechanics behind each algorithm, making complex concepts more accessible and intuitive.
